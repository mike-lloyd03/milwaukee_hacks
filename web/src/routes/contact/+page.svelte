		I wrote this tool to make it easier to find the best deals on certain Milwaukee tool promotions
		at Home Depot. I turned it into a web app to share with the community so others can share in the
		joy of new tools. I also learned some cool stuff about Rust WASM with Typescript.

		My hope is that Milwaukee/TTI and Home Depot won't have a problem with this as, at least in my
		experience, it allows people to buy tools they otherwise wouldn't buy. I've wanted a track saw
		for a long time but simply can't justify $400 for one. In this situation, Milwaukee/Home Depot
		make zero dollars off me. But with the hack, I just bought one for $270. I get a tool that I
		want and the manufacturer gets money out of my pocket. It's a win for everyone.

	<P>If you have code changes, PRs are very welcome.</P>

		If you work for Milwaukee and want to send me free tools that would be great. If instead you
		want me to shut this down, that would make me sad.
